    "Large language models (LLMs) can occasionally generate undesirable outputs. A couple of well-known examples of this behaviour are harmful or hallucinating content. It is important to employ a mechanism to make sure the model’s responses are appropriate in the production environment. Luckily, these foundational models have the required information to correct themselves with a bit of push in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-critique chain will keep the model in line by iterating over its output and checking if the pre-defined expectations are met. If not, it asks the model to fix itself based on the requirement set by the application. For example, it will make sure that a student mentoring assistant will answer the questions fair and ethically. Meaning, to suggest hard work instead of cheating to get the highest mark in an exam."
